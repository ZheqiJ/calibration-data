# UKB DMCA Application Matching Methodology

This project treats the 110 manually verified UK Biobank-related DMCA notices as the fixed notice universe. The pipeline does not re-expand that universe during enrichment runs.

## Interpretation

A match means: a UK Biobank approved application is linked by public evidence to a DMCA-targeted repository lineage.

It does not mean that the application, PI, institution, or original research team violated UKB policy or uploaded participant-level data. DMCA notices are takedown allegations/requests, not legal findings.

## Evidence Sources

The pipeline uses public metadata only:

- GitHub DMCA notice text and target URLs.
- GitHub repository metadata, fork/source/parent metadata, public owner profile name/company, README, and citation metadata files. Citation metadata is searched both at repository root and in public tree locations such as nested `CITATION.cff`, `codemeta.json`, `.zenodo.json`, `DESCRIPTION`, `pyproject.toml`, and `package.json`.
- Exact targeted commit metadata when a DMCA URL contains a 40-character commit SHA.
- GitHub file commit history for the targeted path when available.
- Internet Archive CDX metadata as a fallback for inaccessible repositories, plus README/raw README snapshots when available.
- Public package/archive metadata reached from repository evidence, including Zenodo records, PyPI project metadata, and CRAN/R `DESCRIPTION` package metadata.
- Public DOI/PubMed/Crossref metadata.
- Optional UK Biobank Schema 19 publication metadata and Schema 24 publication-to-application mappings.
- UKB approved application `title`, `pi`, `institution`, and `notes`.

The pipeline must not download, store, or reproduce files alleged to contain participant-level UKB data.

## Deterministic Matching

Deterministic evidence can produce `confirmed` only when it uniquely identifies an application:

- `A1_DIRECT_APP_ID`: a unique UKB application/project/app number appears in notice or public repository evidence.
- `A2_DOI_UKB_CROSSWALK`: a repository-linked DOI maps through Schema 19 and Schema 24 to application(s).
- `A3_PMID_UKB_CROSSWALK`: a repository-linked PMID maps through Schema 19 and Schema 24 to application(s).
- `A4_EXACT_REPO_PUBLICATION_APPLICATION_CHAIN`: reserved for exact public repository-publication-application chains.

Repository-linked DOI/PMID values include identifiers written directly in public
repository evidence and conservative identifiers derived from public publication
URLs. For example, a PubMed URL contributes its PMID, and deterministic Nature
article URLs such as `/articles/s41588-...` contribute the corresponding
`10.1038/...` DOI. Ambiguous legacy URL slugs are left unresolved rather than
guessed.

If a live repository points to Zenodo, PyPI, or CRAN, the pipeline fetches only
public package/archive metadata such as title, DOI, PMID, authors, related
identifiers, project URLs, and descriptions. It does not fetch targeted data
files. For deleted repositories, Wayback is used only to recover README-like
public metadata snapshots; `wayback_readme_first_capture` is an archival
observation date, not a creation date or leakage date.

If a DOI/PMID maps to multiple applications, the lineage is `ambiguous` unless independent identity/context evidence clearly favors one candidate; that case can become `probable`, not `confirmed`.

## Supporting Evidence

B-level evidence supports candidate ranking and `probable` labels:

- DOI/PMID appearing directly in application notes.
- Exact or near-exact publication title evidence.
- Paper author to application PI match.
- Repository owner to paper author match.
- Commit author to paper author match.
- Institution match.
- Multiple mutually consistent public metadata sources.

C-level evidence is weak and is used only for candidate generation/ranking:

- Topic overlap.
- Application notes topic overlap.
- Repository/path similarity.
- Alleged data type similarity.

Generic words such as `cancer`, `genetic`, `imaging`, `risk`, `disease`, `UKB`, and `data` are down-weighted. Data type alone can never produce `confirmed` or `probable`.

## Final Labels

- `confirmed`: unique direct app ID, or a unique deterministic DOI/PMID Schema 19/24 crosswalk from repository-linked publication evidence.
- `probable`: no unique A-level evidence, but several independent B-level components identify one application and the top candidate clearly dominates competitors.
- `ambiguous`: multiple applications remain plausible, including multi-application publication crosswalks that cannot be disambiguated.
- `unresolved`: evidence is missing, generic, or weak.
- `not_application_attributable`: third-party propagation/reposting is evident but no original UKB application can be established.

## Audit Outputs

- `ukb_dmca_application_candidates.csv` preserves all retained candidates and scores.
- `ukb_dmca_application_match_evidence.csv` stores one row per lineage x candidate application x evidence component.
- `evidence/lineages/*.md` records public repository metadata, README/citation/package/Wayback sources, target commit metadata, publication IDs, crosswalk details, and candidate reasons.
- `evidence/logs/result_summary.json` reports method contribution counts, including direct app ID, DOI crosswalk, PMID crosswalk, probable, ambiguous, unresolved, and unique applications linked.

## Current Limitations

Deleted repositories often lack public GitHub metadata. Wayback captures are treated only as archived observations, not repository creation or leakage dates. Commit dates are named targeted/observed commit dates and are not interpreted as leakage dates. Without Schema 19/24 files, DOI/PMID crosswalk matching is disabled and those method contribution counts remain zero.
